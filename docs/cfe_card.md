# DIY CFE-TypeB Card

CFE-TypeB card cost-effective solution.

## Overview
![card](/card.jpg)

DIY CFE-TypeB card only needs NVME SSD + Any CFE-TypeB card holder. I use JEYI 2280 card + Samsung 970EVOPlus 2T to build it, it has extremely fast reading and writing speeds, and has very good heat dissipation effect, but the disadvantage is that the shape is relatively long, which may not be convenient for mini shape. 

Of course, you can also use NVME 2230 SSD card to make a more mini DIY CFE-TypeB card, but I haven't made it yet, so I don't have any recommended brands. I may make one in a few weeks.
