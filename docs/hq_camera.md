[Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) is the highest resolution camera in the Raspberry Pi Foundation. I used it before, but I stopped using it after I used the better [StarlightEye](/starlighteye).

## Usage

Just connect the cable, the driver is already on pi5.
