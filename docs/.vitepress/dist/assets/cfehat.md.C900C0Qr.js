The following introductions are all from Will&#39;s projectðŸ‘‡</p><blockquote><p>Welcome to the GitHub repository for the open-source CFexpress (CFE) PCIe Hat designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi 5. This project aims to enhance the Raspberry Pi 5 by adding the ability to interface with CFexpress Type B cards directly, enabling high-speed data transfer and storage solutions.</p></blockquote><p>I would highly recommend it, it allows you to quickly change storage and reduces the time of transferring to the computer. After you record, you only need to insert the card into the computer and you can edit directly.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-get-it" tabindex="-1">Where can I get it? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-can-i-get-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where can I get it?&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>This is probably the most important issue for you.
