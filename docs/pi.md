# Raspberry Pi 5

The everything computer.

## Overview

Cine Fox is based on cinepi-sdk. Currently, cinepi-sdk only works on Pi5 and can bring out the performance of Pi5. This is the introduction of Pi5 on the official website of Raspberry Pi:

> Raspberry Pi 5 features the Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core Arm Cortex A76 processor @ 2.4GHz, making it up to three times faster than the previous generation. With RAM variants up to 8GB, this is the fastest, smoothest Raspberry Pi experience yet.

Although Pi5 still has some shortcomings, since it is the only choice at present, I don't think I need to introduce it specially.ðŸ™‚

## Usage

It should be noted that Pi5 requires a stable 5V5A power supply and you need to use the necessary cooling fan or heat sink.
